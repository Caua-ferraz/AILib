## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ailib.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ailib
   ```
4. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
5. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Install the development dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Coding Standards

We follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code. Please ensure your code adheres to these standards. Some key points:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- Use docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.

We recommend using tools like `flake8` or `pylint` to check your code before submitting a pull request.

## Testing

We use the `unittest` framework for testing. All new features should be accompanied by appropriate tests. To run the tests:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes and commit them with a clear commit message.
3. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository.
5. In your pull request description, explain the changes you've made and why you've made them.
6. Wait for a maintainer to review your pull request. They may ask for changes or clarifications.

## Documentation

- All modules, classes, and functions should have clear and concise docstrings.
- Update the README.md file if you've added new features or changed existing functionality.
- If you've added new modules or made significant changes, update the docs/ directory with appropriate documentation.
