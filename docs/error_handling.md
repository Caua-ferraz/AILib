# Error Handling

Effective error handling is crucial for building robust AI applications. **AILib** integrates a comprehensive error handling system using custom exceptions to provide clear and informative error messages. This section explains how to use and handle these exceptions within your workflows.

## Custom Exceptions

AILib defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions to handle various error scenarios:

- **`AILibError`**: The base exception for all AILib-related errors.
- **`ModelNotTrainedError`**: Raised when attempting to use a model that hasn't been trained.
- **`UnsupportedModelTypeError`**: Raised for unsupported model types.
- **`InvalidConfigurationError`**: Raised for invalid or missing configurations.

### Example of Custom Exceptions

```python
from ailib.error_handling import (
    AILibError,
    ModelNotTrainedError,
    UnsupportedModelTypeError,
    InvalidConfigurationError
)

try:
    # Initialize a model with an unsupported type
    model = UnifiedModel('unsupported_model')
except UnsupportedModelTypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

try:
    # Load a model and attempt to predict without training
    model = AIModel('neural_network')
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
except ModelNotTrainedError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Handling Exceptions

To gracefully handle errors in your AI workflows, wrap your code in try-except blocks and catch specific AILib exceptions.

```python
from ailib import Config, setup_logging
from ailib import AIModel, AILibError
from ailib.error_handling import ModelNotTrainedError, UnsupportedModelTypeError

# Load configuration and set up logging
try:
    config = Config.load_config('config.json')
    setup_logging(config)
except AILibError as e:
    print(f"Configuration Error: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Initialize and train model
try:
    model = AIModel('neural_network')
    model.train(X_train, y_train)
except UnsupportedModelTypeError as e:
    print(f"Model Initialization Error: {e}")
    exit(1)
except AILibError as e:
    print(f"Training Error: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Make predictions
try:
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
except ModelNotTrainedError as e:
    print(f"Prediction Error: {e}")
except AILibError as e:
    print(f"Unexpected Error: {e}")
```

## Raising Custom Exceptions

When developing custom functionalities or extending AILib, use the provided custom exceptions to maintain consistency.

```python
from ailib.error_handling import AILibError

def custom_function():
    try:
        # Some operation that may fail
        pass
    except SomeSpecificException as e:
        raise AILibError(f"Custom function failed: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

- **Specific Exception Handling**: Catch specific exceptions before catching general ones to handle different error scenarios appropriately.
  
  ```python
  try:
      # Code that may raise exceptions
      pass
  except UnsupportedModelTypeError as e:
      # Handle unsupported model type
      pass
  except ModelNotTrainedError as e:
      # Handle untrained model
      pass
  except AILibError as e:
      # Handle other AILib-related errors
      pass
  except Exception as e:
      # Handle unforeseen errors
      pass
  ```

- **Logging Errors**: Utilize AILib's integrated logging system to log errors for easier debugging and monitoring.
  
  ```python
  import logging
  from ailib.error_handling import AILibError

  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

  try:
      # Code that may raise exceptions
      pass
  except AILibError as e:
      logger.error(f"AILib Error: {e}")
  except Exception as e:
      logger.exception(f"Unexpected Error: {e}")
  ```

- **Avoid Silent Failures**: Do not suppress exceptions without handling them. Always log or handle errors to prevent silent failures.
